    <h1> Cause: misconception prep</h1>
    <p>A major misconception about my cause The Elimination of Gas Cars, is that most people do not understand how burning fuel affects the environment. Most, if not all of the people who have a misconception about my cause do not believe that climate change is real. Driving gas cars ultimately increases global warming. Many people around the world drive in gas cars, including myself, but most aren’t aware that they are a big reason why climate change is such a big deal in today’s society. In this essay, I will be providing many facts that will help debunk the myths many people have based on their misconceptions. Fact 1 is that the fuel  burning excretes bad gases that stay trapped inside of our atmosphere and will not be able to get out. Fact 2 is that people also cannot afford to not use gas fueled cars because of their socioeconomic background. Fact 3 is that the gases trapped inside of the atmosphere melt our icecaps, burn our forests, and put our land underwater (and much more).Fact 4 is that GLOBAL WARMING IS REAL. If people truly care about their environment, the planet they live on and the lives of billions of people, mammals and sea creatures, they understand that the Earth is dependant on us to keep it running. If not, then the Earth will kick us out- by killing us. Many people who are against my cause may think that it is just impossible for everyone to switch to electric cars but it is actually not. It all starts with one person and if money is an issue then that is only a temporary problem compared to the near permanent issue we are facing. If people just see the bigger picture with the wellbeing of our Earth, they will understand that it also affects us directly.  There is always an effect to our cause, and my cause will most definitely have a positive effect in the long run.
